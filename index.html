                This here writing is Ariel Ritchey of Web Development II. I'm currently a freshman in my second semester (previously had taken a gap year). At the start of my journey, I had no idea what coding was, or looked like for that matter - I merely took up a free offer of joining the Girls Who Code program of June 2020 after viewing an advertisement on Instagram. With this class, I hope to gain much more experience as a web developer and create things that I can be proud of.
